  <p>The tree topologies in the above study will serve as backbone for this study. The anapid and
    symphytognathid female spiders have reduced palp while many of their species have completely
    lost the palps. I will conduct a total evidence analysis using morphology and molecular data.
    Here, optimization of palpal characters on the resulting tree topology will date the evolution of
    palp, its reduction and loss or secondary gain in other spiders. A previous claim that
    ‘miniaturization’ is not convergence can also be tested using advanced techniques. This study
    will provide a greater understanding about character evolution in cryptic arthropods.</p>
