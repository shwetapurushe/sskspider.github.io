  <p>I'm fascinated by the evolving biodiversity and its maintenance on our planet. As i continue my training as a
    phylogeneticist, I study arachnid evolution as a model using advanced genomic and
    transcriptomic technologies.</p>
  <p>  My goal is to understand patterns in their evolution and trace any
    pattern in the exceptions that can explain the extant diversity.
    Given that no data matrix is ever complete in real scientific world, I am working on probabilistic
    models that can explain the effect of the missing data and ways to alleviate it. My present
    affiliations- George Washington University, Washington, D.C. and Smithsonianâ€™s National
    Museum of Natural History, Washington, D.C. play most active roles in nurturing my scientific
    interests.
    During weekends, I play with little snippets codes to test the potential in my developing philosophy
    about how to test evolutionary hypotheses. Once a month, I engage with citizen scientists
    across south Asia and help documenting spiders (e.g. SpiderIndia group on iNaturalist,
    Facebook and India Biodiversity Portal), a long-term initiative to document spiders from south
    Asia.
    I do have a life other than evolutionary study wherein I love to travel and play cricket.</p>
